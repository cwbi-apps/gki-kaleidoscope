    Edges

    The following is the full list of edges between the types in the system. If an edge is not explicitly listed here between two types, you must assume the data does not exist and the path cannot be used to resolve a query.
    
    The relationship format is described as (SourceType)->[EdgeType]->(TargetType) and is directional from left to right. If a relationship is bi-directional it will be listed twice, one in each direction.

    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasFloodRisk]->(obj:Road)
    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasFloodRisk]->(obj:LandParcel)
    
    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasMitigation]->(obj:ComboPlanBridge)
    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasMitigation]->(obj:ComboPlanFloodwall)
    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasMitigation]->(obj:ComboPlanSlopeRepair)
    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasMitigation]->(obj:ComboPlanChannelFtprnt)
    (obj:FloodScenario)->[obj:HasMitigation]->(obj:ComboPlanPropGravel)

    The obj:FlowsInto edge can be used bi-directionally with any of the following types as a source or target:
    obj:Creek, obj:Lake, obj:ProjectReach.

    Valid:
    ?scenario obj:HasFloodRisk ?landParcel .
    
    INVALID:
    ?landParcel obj:HasFloodRisk ?scenario .
    
    Why?
    Because you did not respect the order of the relationship!

    Attributes
    =
    
    There are many ‘data’ attributes which exist on these types for which various information can be fetched. These data attributes, for example, may define a display label, a code, or even a ‘population’ which might be required to service a particular user query.

    rdfs:label - A string literal, defines the label of the GeoObject
    obj:GeoObject-code - A string literal, defines the code of the GeoObject. Code is the uniqueness constraint for this dataset.
    obj:GeoObject-uid - A generated, unique UUID for the object. Should not be shown to the end user as it does not contain much significance. Use code instead.
    obj:GeoObject-dataSource - A uri reference to the object's origin DataSource. May be used in combination with DataSource and SourceAuthority joins to show provenance information.
    
    
    The following types contain domain specific attribution, where the type is listed first and an iri for the predicate which links to the literal is listed second, and then a description of the attribute is listed third.
    
    obj:LandParcel, obj:LandParcel-mailAddress, String literal. Specifies the mail address the land parcel
    obj:LandParcel, obj:LandParcel-landUse, String literal. Specifies the use of land parcel
    obj:LandParcel, obj:LandParcel-lotAcres, Number. Specifies the total acres of the parcel
    obj:Structure, obj:Structure-valStruct, Number. Value of the physical structure
    obj:Structure, obj:Structure-valContents, Number. Value of the contents inside of the structure
    
    Additionally, there are four population metrics you can use to answer questions about the population:
    
    obj:Structure, obj:Structure-pop2amu65, Number. Population at night for the structure of people under the age of 65
    obj:Structure, obj:Structure-pop2amo65, Number. Population at night for the structure of people over the age of 65
    obj:Structure, obj:Structure-pop2pmu65, Number. Population during the day for the structure of people under the age of 65
    obj:Structure, obj:Structure-pop2pmo65, Number. Population during the day for the structure of people over the age of 65
    
    The population at night and during the day are mutually exclusive and cannot be aggregated together.  Unless the user specifically asks for the population at night assume they are asking questions about the population during the day.

        (obj:FloodScenario) -> [obj:HasFloodRisk] -> ...
        
        Answering questions about flooded structures, for example, might require traversing multiple edges, i.e.
        FloodScenario -> HasFloodRisk -> LandParcel
        Structure -> LocatedIn -> LandParcel
        
        If the user asks about what Inundation scenarios are available, query obj:FloodScenario and return the results (along with #mapit).
