/**
 * Runs long-lived requests (chat prompts and location lookups) on a
 * background thread and hands the caller a job id to poll, instead of
 * blocking the HTTP request thread until the work finishes.
 *
 * These requests invoke a Bedrock AgentCore harness which can take up to
 * several minutes to respond -- comfortably longer than the ALB's 60
 * second idle timeout, which was causing 504 Gateway Timeout errors.
 * Returning immediately with a job id (a 202 Accepted) lets the controller
 * respond in milliseconds while the work continues in the background; the
 * client is expected to poll {@link #getStatus(String)} until the job
 * reports SUCCEEDED or FAILED.
 *
 * Job state is held in memory on this instance. That is sufficient as long
 * as this service runs as a single instance (or behind an ALB with sticky
 * sessions) -- if it is ever horizontally scaled without sticky sessions,
 * this store should move to a shared backing store (e.g. a database or
 * ElastiCache) so a poll doesn't land on an instance that never ran the
 * job.

   * The task itself (Bedrock AgentCore calls, SPARQL/Neptune queries, ...)
   * is expected to fail on its own well before this via its own timeouts --
   * but not every downstream client is guaranteed to have one configured
   * correctly, and a hung task would otherwise leave the job RUNNING
   * forever with no way for a client to ever learn it isn't coming back.
   * This is the backstop that guarantees getStatus() always reaches a
   * terminal state in bounded time.
   *
   * Kept slightly under the front-end's own polling deadline (see
   * job-polling.util.ts, MAX_POLL_DURATION_MS = 15 minutes) so the client
   * gets a clean, descriptive FAILED status from here instead of racing its
   * own client-side timeout. (Also gives chat/prompt and chat/get-locations
   * room to exhaust their 3-attempt Bedrock retry policy in ChatService --
   * up to ~15 minutes at 5 minutes per attempt -- without this watchdog
   * cutting them off mid-retry.)
   *
   * Note this does not (and cannot, in general) interrupt the background
   * thread -- a task stuck in a downstream call with no timeout of its own
   * may keep running after its job has been marked FAILED. Configuring
   * proper timeouts on every downstream client remains the real fix; this
   * is only the safety net that keeps that failure mode from reaching the
